# Arduino-Projects
This repository contains codes of some basic arduino projects.

## Bluetooth Differential Drive
The file named Bluetooth.ino contains a full-fledged arduino code to run a bluetooth controlled DD (Differential Drive). The code is easy to understand as it includes all the necessary comments.

## Radar System
The hardware was prepared using Arduino UNO and an Ultrsonic sensor mounted on a servo motor
This folder contains two codes:
1. **distance_and_angle:** this .ino file contains calculation of distance and angle of an obstacle using ultrasonic sensor, servo motor and Arduino UNO.
2. **position_detection:** this .ino file contains calculation of x and y coordinates of the obstacle from the radar system.
